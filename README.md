## Development Schedule

I plan to use my weekends from now until the due date, 12/01, to complete this project. Specifically Saturdays and Sundays.

* Saturday 11/02 and Sunday 11/03: 2 hours
  This upcoming weekend, I intend to build out the general design of my distributed system. I will create my Dockerfile, my docker-compose file, and most likely make a primitive node.py file.
* Saturday 11/09 and Sunday 11/10: 2 hours
* Saturday 11/16 and Sunday 11/17: 2 hours
* Saturday 11/23 and Sunday 11/24: 2 hours
* Saturday 11/30 and Sunday 12/01: 2 hours
